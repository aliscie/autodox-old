//! This is the main (and only for now) application Error type.
//! It's using 'thiserror' as it reduces boilerplate error code while providing rich error typing.
//!
//! Notes:
//!     - The strategy is to start with one Error type for the whole application and then seggregate as needed.
//!     - Since everything is typed from the start, renaming and refactoring become relatively trivial.
//!     - By best practices, `anyhow` is not used in application code, but can be used in unit or integration test (will be in dev_dependencies when used)
//!
